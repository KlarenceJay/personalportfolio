    The Playlist on Netflix is an amazing film that takes the viewers through a journey into people's emotions using the language of songs. In the first episode it beautifully shows the connection between music and out daily lives. With the background music becoming a tool used for conveying emotions through songs.
    <br><br>
    The characters are extremely well-written, and the actors did an amazing job portraying them. The background music in the episode significantly adds depth because it seems that the characters emotions have been shown using songs. It is not merely background noise; it is as if the characters themselves are singing their emotions through the music, adding to the overall storytelling.
    <br><br>
    In relation to the storytelling, the cinematography is amazing because it possesses the unique ability to visually translate the music. In the episode scenes that were choreographed to the rhythm or beat of a song elevated the emotional impact and created a captivating and immersive experience for the viewers.  The careful use of lighting and color also further enhance the storytelling quality of the episode by creating a visual that complements the music.
    <br><br>
    For me a standout moment occurs in the beginning of the episode when Daniel Ek's mother dances to her favorite song. I loved this scene because it beautifully shos how music has the ability to evole emotions such as happiness and joy in our daily lives while emphasizing impact on our own well-being. 
    <br><br>
    I commend Daniel for his success in creating a company that initially seemed impossible. The series portrays his journey, highlighting the struggles he faced, yet he persisted in pursuing his passion. Many individuals have lost interest in their job or hobbies because of failure and mistakes that happen in the process so I love that the episode shown someone overcoming the stress and kept pursuing their goal.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, The Playlist stands as a testament to the power of storytelling through the use of music. With it's well-written characters, exceptional cinematography, and valuable lessons, it promises to be a educational and enriching experience for those whodelve into its story.
